Menu Creation in Drupal: Content Menu and Self-Service Menu
As part of enhancing the site's navigation, we are creating two new custom menus within Drupal:

Content Menu:

Purpose: The Content Menu will serve as a central navigation tool for managing and organizing content across the site. This menu will allow administrators to configure menu lists and pages that are directly related to content navigation. It will streamline access to various content types, making it easier for users to find and manage the content they need.

Usage: This menu is particularly useful for site administrators and content managers who need to organize the website’s content structure effectively. It can be used to group content types, categories, and individual content items into a logical and user-friendly hierarchy.

Self-Service Menu:

Purpose: The Self-Service Menu is designed to provide users with a clear and intuitive pathway to access their self-service pages. This menu will include links to user-specific pages such as profile management, account settings, and other personal user tools.

Usage: This menu is intended to improve user experience by offering a streamlined navigation option for users to manage their accounts and access personalized services. It will be primarily accessible to authenticated users, offering them a convenient way to manage their interactions with the site.






Adding Sub-Menu Links in Drupal
Once the Content Menu and Self-Service Menu are created in the Drupal site, content creators can easily add sub-menu links through the content creation or edit page. Here are the steps:

Steps to Add Sub-Menu Links:
Log in to the Drupal Admin Interface:

Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to add or edit content and manage menu links.
Navigate to Create or Edit Content:

Go to the desired content creation page (e.g., "Add Content" under "Content" in the admin toolbar).
Alternatively, if you’re editing existing content, locate the content via the "Content" tab and click on "Edit" for that specific item.
Locate the Menu Settings Option:

On the content creation or edit page, scroll down to find the "Menu Settings" option, typically located towards the bottom of the page.
Click to expand the "Menu Settings" section.
Enable Menu Link Creation:

Check the box labeled "Provide a menu link." This action will allow you to add a link to either the Content Menu or the Self-Service Menu.
Configure the Menu Link:

Menu Link Title: Enter the title you want to appear in the menu.
Parent Item: From the dropdown list, select the appropriate parent menu where you want this link to appear:
Choose "Content Menu" for links related to content navigation.
Choose "Self-Service Menu" for links related to user self-service pages.
Weight: Optionally, set the "Weight" of the menu item to determine its order relative to other menu items. Lower numbers appear higher in the list.
Save and Publish:

Once you’ve configured the menu link, save the content as usual.
Upon saving, the new sub-menu link will be added under the selected parent menu, making it accessible through the site’s navigation.
Additional Notes:
You can always return to edit the content and adjust the menu settings if needed.
The changes will reflect immediately in the site's navigation menus after saving the content.
