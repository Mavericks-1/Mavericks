We've installed Composer as part of setting up the local development environment in VDI. However, we're encountering the following certificate error when executing any Composer commands. We set the proxy to xxx during installation and have confirmed that the environment variable is being set correctly.

Do you have any insights into why this issue might be occurring? Any help would be appreciated.








Content Menu and Self-Service Menu are created in the Drupal site, content creators can easily add sub-menu links through the content creation or edit page. Here are the steps:

Steps to Add Sub-Menu Links:
Log in to the Drupal Admin Interface:

Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to add or edit content and manage menu links.
Navigate to Create or Edit Content:

Go to the desired content creation page (e.g., "Add Content" under "Content" in the admin toolbar).
Alternatively, if you’re editing existing content, locate the content via the "Content" tab and click on "Edit" for that specific item.
Locate the Menu Settings Option:

On the content creation or edit page, scroll down to find the "Menu Settings" option, typically located towards the bottom of the page.
Click to expand the "Menu Settings" section.
Enable Menu Link Creation:

Check the box labeled "Provide a menu link." This action will allow you to add a link to either the Content Menu or the Self-Service Menu.
Configure the Menu Link:

Menu Link Title: Enter the title you want to appear in the menu.
Parent Item: From the dropdown list, select the appropriate parent menu where you want this link to appear:
Choose "Content Menu" for links related to content navigation.
Choose "Self-Service Menu" for links related to user self-service pages.
Weight: Optionally, set the "Weight" of the menu item to determine its order relative to other menu items. Lower numbers appear higher in the list.
Save and Publish:

Once you’ve configured the menu link, save the content as usual.
Upon saving, the new sub-menu link will be added under the selected parent menu, making it accessible through the site’s navigation.
Additional Notes:
You can always return to edit the content and adjust the menu settings if needed.
The changes will reflect immediately in the site's navigation menus after saving the content.





Default Error Handling in Drupal for Menu Management
Form Validation:

Description: When creating or editing a menu link, Drupal automatically validates the input fields. If required fields (like the "Menu link title" or "Link path") are left blank, or if an invalid URL is entered, Drupal will display an error message and prevent the form from being submitted until the errors are resolved.
User Feedback: Users are alerted with a red error message near the problematic field, explaining what needs to be corrected.
Permission Checks:

Description: Drupal checks the user’s permissions before allowing access to menu management functions. If a user without the necessary permissions tries to create, edit, or delete a menu link, Drupal will deny access and display an "Access Denied" message.
User Feedback: The user sees an "Access Denied" message or is redirected to a page explaining they do not have the necessary permissions.
Path Validation:

Description: Drupal checks whether the path entered in the "Link path" field is valid. If the path points to a non-existent or unpublished page, Drupal will flag this and may display an error message.
User Feedback: A warning or error message is displayed if the entered path does not match any existing content or valid URL.
Conflict Resolution:

Description: Drupal handles potential conflicts in menu structure, such as duplicate paths or titles, by appending numeric suffixes or issuing warnings. This helps prevent conflicts that could cause navigation issues.
User Feedback: Drupal may automatically adjust conflicting items or provide a notification to the user about the conflict.
Automatic Menu Item Removal:

Description: If a piece of content is deleted, any associated menu links pointing to that content are automatically removed. This prevents broken links from appearing in the menu.
User Feedback: No direct feedback is usually provided, but the menu item will no longer appear after the content is deleted.
Error Logging:

Description: Drupal logs various errors, including issues related to menu management, in the system logs. These logs can be accessed by administrators to diagnose and resolve issues.
User Feedback: Administrators can view detailed error messages and logs under "Reports" > "Recent log messages" to troubleshoot issues.
Cache Management:

Description: Drupal automatically clears relevant cache entries when menu structures are updated. This ensures that changes are reflected across the site, minimizing issues caused by stale cache data.
User Feedback: While this process is automatic, users can manually clear the cache if they notice that changes are not being immediately reflected.
Handling Missing Parent Items:

Description: If a menu link is assigned a parent item that is later removed, Drupal will reassign the orphaned menu link to the top level of the menu or another valid parent. This prevents the link from being lost.
User Feedback: The link remains visible in the menu, but its position may change.



The header logo and background color change on hover, which might not be ideal for a consistent design.
The submenu items are revealed only on click, rather than on hover, which could affect user experience.
The menu structure is overly complex, with different classes assigned to each menu column, each having unique styles. This makes it difficult to implement a dynamic approach.
The widths of the divs are defined in pixels instead of percentages, limiting responsiveness and scalability.
These are some key observations from our quick review of the global header design.





==============


Creating a menu in Drupal involves several steps, from installation to using modules for customization. Here are the design specifications you need for the task:

1. Drupal Installation
Drupal Version: Ensure you're using the latest stable version of Drupal (e.g., Drupal 9 or 10).
Installation Method: Use either Composer or Drush to install Drupal for better dependency management.
bash
Copy code
composer create-project drupal/recommended-project my_site_name
Web Server: Set up an Apache or Nginx server to host your Drupal site.
Database: Use MySQL or MariaDB for database management.
2. Modules Required for Menu Creation
Core Modules:
Drupal's core already includes menu management features, but here are a few useful core modules:

Menu UI: Enables the admin interface for creating and managing menus.
Menu Link Content: Provides a content entity type to manage menu links.
Contributed Modules:
Depending on your project requirements, you might also need some contributed modules for advanced menu features:

Menu Block: Allows you to create and display menus in custom blocks, which is useful for site-wide placement of menus.
Superfish: For creating responsive, dropdown menus with advanced styling options.
Menu Item Extras: Allows attaching fields to menu items, useful for adding metadata or custom attributes.
Pathauto: Automatically generates SEO-friendly URLs that work well with custom menus.
Linkit: Provides an easy interface to link content internally or externally within menu items.
3. Menu Creation Process
Steps:
Admin Interface: After installing Drupal, log in to the admin interface.
Create Menus: Go to Structure > Menus and click "Add Menu" to create a new menu.
Title: Give the menu a name (e.g., "Main Navigation").
Description: Optionally, provide a description of the menu’s purpose.
Add Menu Links: Within the created menu, click "Add Link."
Menu Link Title: Define the text that will be shown on the menu.
Link Path: Provide the internal or external URL the menu item will point to.
Parent Item: Select if the menu link will be a child of another menu link (for creating nested menus).
Weight: Adjust the order of the menu item relative to others.
Menu Block Display:
After creating a menu, navigate to Structure > Block Layout and place the menu block in a region (e.g., Header, Sidebar, etc.).
Customize block visibility, title, and styling.
4. Theme Integration
Custom Themes: If you are using a custom theme, integrate the menu using the theme’s .twig templates. For example, for the main menu, you would place the following code in your page.html.twig template:
twig
Copy code
{{ drupal_menu('main-menu') }}
Responsive Design: Ensure your menu is responsive, particularly if you're using dropdowns or mobile menus.
Superfish or Megamenu modules can help with this.
5. Permissions
Set proper permissions for who can view and manage the menu. Navigate to People > Permissions and configure roles such as Administrator, Editor, and Authenticated User.
6. Caching
Enable caching for menus in Drupal to ensure fast performance. This can be done via the Performance settings in the Configuration menu.
Consider using the BigPipe module to optimize page rendering by loading menus and dynamic content efficiently.
Example Workflow Summary:
Install Drupal.
Enable Menu UI and Menu Link Content modules (core).
Install contributed modules like Superfish for advanced menus.
Create a menu via the Structure menu.
Use a theme .twig template to display the menu.
Ensure proper permissions and caching settings.
This approach will help you to set up and manage menus efficiently in Drupal.
